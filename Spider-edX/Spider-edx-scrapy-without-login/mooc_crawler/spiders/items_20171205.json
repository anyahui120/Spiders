Algunos de los temas que cubriremos:\n\nLos astr\u00f3nomos modernos combinan datos de m\u00faltiples tipos de telescopios para crear im\u00e1genes compuestas de objetos en el espacio.\nLos agujeros negros son por definici\u00f3n imposibles de observar directamente usando telescopios de luz, ya que ninguna luz puede escapar de su extrema gravedad.\nLa \u00fanica manera de estudiar los agujeros negros usando telescopios de luz es observar cualquier gas y polvo que caiga en ellos. Esto puede revelar informaci\u00f3n sobre un agujero, como la frecuencia con la que gira alrededor de su eje.\n\nComprensi\u00f3n de la gravedad.\n\nEn el siglo XVII, Isaac Newton propuso una ley universal de gravitaci\u00f3n que conceb\u00eda la gravedad como una fuerza entre dos masas (m1m1 y m2m2) separadas por una distancia rr seg\u00fan la ecuaci\u00f3n: F = Gm1m2r2F = Gm1m2r2\nLa teor\u00eda de Newton es muy exacta para la mayor\u00eda de las situaciones y es ampliamente utilizada hoy en d\u00eda. Sin embargo, Newton estaba preocupado por la acci\u00f3n a distancia, quer\u00eda entender c\u00f3mo dos masas se conocen y se influyen mutuamente sin enviar ninguna se\u00f1al.\nEste problema no se resolvi\u00f3 hasta que Albert Einstein propuso la relatividad general en 1916. En su nueva concepci\u00f3n la gravedad no es una fuerza, sino la geometr\u00eda del espacio-tiempo. Los objetos masivos causan que el espacio-tiempo se curve, y esta curvatura es lo que influye en el movimiento de otros objetos en el espacio-tiempo. El mensajero gravitacional de Newton result\u00f3 ser el espacio-tiempo en s\u00ed.\nEinstein se dio cuenta de que objetos masivos (no esf\u00e9ricamente sim\u00e9tricos) sometidos a aceleraci\u00f3n u oscilaci\u00f3n producir\u00edan distorsiones que se extender\u00edan a trav\u00e9s del espacio-tiempo como ondulaciones en un estanque. Estas ondulaciones se llaman ondas gravitacionales.\nAl igual que las ondas electromagn\u00e9ticas, las ondas gravitatorias transportan energ\u00eda y tienen amplitudes (llamadas tensi\u00f3n para las ondas gravitacionales) y frecuencias asociadas con ellas. Las ondas gravitatorias se representan a menudo como formas de onda, que demuestran su frecuencia y amplitud mientras que cambian con el tiempo.\nLas ondas gravitacionales interact\u00faan muy d\u00e9bilmente con la materia, pasando por todo esencialmente sin cambios. Esto es muy \u00fatil para la astronom\u00eda porque significa que cualquier se\u00f1al detectada permanece pr\u00e1cticamente inalterada desde cuando se gener\u00f3 en la fuente.\n", "start": "2017-11-27T05:00:00", "short_description": "En este curso, junto con la Dra.

But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.\nIn today\u2019s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners\u2019 values and emotions \u2013 it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.\nWhen you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents \u2013 and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience.

In this course you will analyse what it takes to create a circular economy including sustainable supply chains.\nCircular economy challenge \nThe transition towards a circular economy is one of the biggest challenges in order to create a more sustainable society. This transition requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining socio-technical, managerial, and environmental considerations.\nValuable resources often end up as waste. We challenge you to find and analyse examples of this in your own environment. You could consider possible solutions to reduce or recycle waste, but you soon realise that waste is not the only problem. Precious materials such as copper, gold and phosphorus are gradually disappearing. Water is becoming scarce, pollution of water and air is massive and a lot of food is thrown away.\nRight now we design products from cradle to grave: from production to consumption to waste, which is a linear model. But we should design products from cradle to cradle: in a closed loop whereby they don\u2019t become waste, but valuable resources again. And when we start thinking in circles, we might as well try to reinvent not just supply chains, but entire systems.\nBecause that\u2019s what we have been doing with sustainability: we have been departing from the status quo, while cradle to cradle and circular pushes us to think outside the box.\nConventional understanding of sustainability proposes activities defined in terms of decreasing and reducing, such as \u2018zero footprint\u2019, \u2018zero waste\u2019, reduction of pollution, reduction of energy consumption. The focus is on reducing negative impacts. We call this eco-efficiency, which is often seen as a goal in itself \u2013 we can keep doing what we do, just strive to do it less.\nCradle to Cradle celebrates abundance; it recognises that people, just like ants and trees, are abundant and have a large impact on their environment. The challenge is to make this impact a positive one and we invite you to join this challenge!\nSystems approach to circular economy \nIn this course, we therefore take a systems approach to the circular economy, considering different stakeholder perspectives, their incentive structures, and their impacts on circular alternatives.\nThe circular solutions will be identified by technological assessment using applied as well as emerging technologies. Since identifying and evaluating potential circular alternatives based on quantitative techniques is key in achieving sustainable solutions, you will also learn how to use life cycle assessment and agent-based modelling to assess the socio-technical and manageable challenges and environmental benefits of alternative solutions.\nBy integrating all perspectives in a case study, you will learn how to comprehensively and critically assess strategies to transition towards a circular economy.", "start": "2017-10-24T04:00:00", "short_description": "Join the transition towards a circular economy considering economic, supply chain, social, technical, managerial and environmental aspects.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:WageningenX+BB05x+3T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "WageningenX", "level_type": "Advanced", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": ["MicroMasters"]},

Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services.\nSystems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders.\nThe course covers five main areas:\n\nIntroduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities.\nMeasuring cybersecurity. We introduce state of the art security and IT metrics and conceptualize the characteristics of a security metric, its challenges and advantages.\nEconomics of information security investment. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments in network security.\nSecurity market failures. We discuss market failures that may lead to cybersecurity investment levels that are insufficient from society\u2019s perspective and other forms of unsafe behaviour in cyber space.\nBehavioural economics for information security, policy and regulation. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.\n\nAfter finishing this course, you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics to cybersecurity. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats.\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.", "start": "2017-10-10T04:00:00", "short_description": "Learn how to make better decisions about security and IT by using state-of-the-art economic tools, security metrics and data analytics.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:DelftX+Secon101x+3T_2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "DelftX", "level_type": "Intermediate", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": []},

This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.   \nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life \u2014 agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.  \nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.   \nThe course\u2019s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

No technical skills or understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the cultural sector are needed for this part.\nGLAM professionals (Galleries, Libraries, *Archives* and Museums). The information provided here presuppose a professional knowledge of the sector. The aim is to help GLAM professional discovering and understanding useful tools - such as those on the E-Space platform and Europeana Labs - that can be used to enhance, remix, rethink, play with collections in new and fascinating ways.\nDevelopers. This is the most technical part of each module and it is intended as a way for developers to discover the tools they can work with.\n\nDigital cultural heritage is online and ready to be creatively reused by you.

You will learn how to become aware of this deeply felt knowledge by giving attention to your body as felt from the inside and to your emotions.\nOur person-centered approach encourages building optimal human relationships through empathy, respect and authenticity. These are complex skills, which we will bring within your reach by means of simple exercises.\nThrough examples, role-play and video-demonstrations we will illustrate how you can apply our existential well-being approach in a variety of helping contexts, including counseling and psychotherapy. You will develop skills to embody the existential well-being approach as a person and as a professional.\nYour learning will be enriched through exchanging thoughts and experiences with a diverse group of international participants. You will learn to notice how people from different cultures have different ideas about what it means to live well and meaningfully. You will engage in discussions where divergent values can be respectfully acknowledged. Your personal view of well-being will expand and deepen to a more universal perspective on what it means to be human.\nThis course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in existential psychotherapy, focusing -oriented and emotion-focused therapy, person-centered counseling and positive psychology.\nThe instructors are also teachers and researchers in the fields of psychotherapy, positive psychology, meaning and spirituality at KU Leuven, a prestigious European University.\nThis course offers you a high degree of flexibility.

As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.  \nThe first part of this course is comprised of five lessons that introduce the theory of causal diagrams and describe its applications to causal inference. The fifth lesson provides a simple graphical description of the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment in the presence of time-varying covariates. The second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the health and social sciences.  \nProfessor Photo Credit: Anders Ahlbom", "start": "2017-09-26T04:00:00", "short_description": "Learn simple graphical rules that allow you to use intuitive pictures to improve study design and data analysis for causal inference.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:HarvardX+PH559x+3T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "HarvardX", "level_type": "Introductory", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": []},

Introduction to Biobased Sciences\nLearn about the products that can be derived from biomass and the processes used to do so, compared to current fossil based products and processes.\n2. Biorefinery\nBiorefinery deals with the challenge of extracting valuable biomass components and converting them to final products. To achieve this you first need knowledge of the different types of biomass, the molecules present and their chemical characteristics. Biorefinery is all about efficient processing. Aspects of processing include the harvesting, pre-treatments, conversion and separation technologies.\n3. Consumer Behaviour\nUnderstand the challenges of moving towards a biobased economy and gaining consumer acceptance. How do consumers evaluate products? And how is their perception influenced by communication strategies? Understanding the basics of consumer science will help you to implement a consumer view when developing a product. \n4. Biomass production\nA biobased economy runs on biomass. It is therefore important to understand which factors play a major role in crop growth, yield formation and quality. In this module you\u2019ll learn to identify design criteria for the production of biobased crops on both a crop and farm level.\n5.

Cyberspace offers greater freedoms and access to information at the same time as we discover a dramatic global rise of cyber espionage, internet censorship, and surveillance.\nIn this course, we map this emerging new terrain where violent conflict, information technology, and global media intersect and where the old distinctions between battlefront and home front, between soldier and civilian, between war and entertainment, and between public and private are being redrawn. \nConsidering these changes, this course engages with questions surrounding:\n\nThe relationship between media, information technology, and war\nHow violent conflict is presented in the media and the responsibilities of journalists during wartime\nThe effect of instantaneous, worldwide reporting on battle and the politics of conflict\nHow we can understand and critically engage with media and information technology\n\nIn order to engage with these questions, this course is taught through a number of conventional and unconventional forms of learning methods and activities. These include lecture videos, questionnaires, and discussion fora. But it also includes practical, experiential elements taught through crowdsourcing, individual research, critical viewing, media and image analysis, and surveys.

The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to \u201cvisualize\u201d the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry\u2019s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo\u2019s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.\nThe course will cover the following topics in four modules:\n\nModule 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?\nModule 1: Black Ships & Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.\nModule 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive \"Hibiya Riot\" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of \"imperial democracy\" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.\nModule 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido & Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s.

In this module you will learn what major pollutants are present in the sewage and why we need to treat sewage prior to discharge to surface waters. The functional units will be briefly discussed\nPrimary treatment. In this module you learn how coarse material, sand & grit are removed from the sewage and how to design primary clarification tanks\nBiological treatment. In this module you learn the basics of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycle and how biological processes are used to treat the main pollutants of concern.\nActivated sludge process. In this module you learn the design principles of conventional activated sludge processes including the secondary clarifiers and aeration demand of aeration tanks.\nNitrogen and phosphorus removal. In this module you learn the principles of biological nitrogen removal as well as phosphorus removal by biological and/or chemical means.\nSludge treatment. In this module you will the design principles of sludge thickeners, digesters and dewatering facilities for the concentration and stabilisation of excess sewage sludge. Potentials for energy recovery via the produced biogas will be discussed as well as the direct anaerobic treatment of urban sewage in UASB reactors when climate conditions allow.\n\nThis course in combination with the courses \"Introduction to Water and Climate\" and \"Introduction to Drinking Water Treatment\" forms the Water XSeries, by DelftX.\n\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.", "start": "2017-08-02T04:00:00", "short_description": "Learn about urban water services, focusing on basic sewage treatment technologies.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:DelftX+CTB3365STx+2T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": "2018-02-27T00:00:00", "org": "DelftX", "level_type": "Intermediate", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": ["XSeries"]},

While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs\u2019 transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called \u201cdead donor rule\u201d and allow \u201corgan-donation euthanasia\u201d? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. _", "start": "2017-03-28T04:00:00", "short_description": "En este curso analizaremos algunos interrogantes \u00e9ticos y jur\u00eddicos que suscita el trasplante de \u00f3rganos.  \nIn this course we will assess the ethical and legal challenges posed by organ transplantation.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:UAMx+TxEtj201x+1T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "UAMx", "level_type": "Intermediate", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English", "Spanish"], "program_types": []},

In 2015 more than 33,000 people died from overdoses involving opioids. Every day in the United States more than 1,000 people are treated in emergency departments for not using prescription opioids as directed. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S., and opioid addiction is driving this epidemic.\nThis course challenges preconceptions about addiction and about who can become addicted to opioids. Our main goals are to reduce the stigma that exists around addiction, help prevent overdose deaths and encourage people to learn about the multiple pathways to treatment. You will learn about these topics from a variety of medical experts and hear from people who have experienced addiction themselves, or who have lost a family member to an overdose.\nThis course is available for Continuing Education credit.

In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian.\nArchitecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations.\nThe first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history.\nIn the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture.\nThe final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.\nHonor Code\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.  \nBy considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.  \nControl technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.  \nCharacterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course.

As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules.\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.\nFAQ\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\nNo, you can learn the contents without any textbooks.

The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project.  \nWe\u2019ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing.  \nConsider this course a survey of best practices: we\u2019d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it\u2019ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues.

Although largely ignored by literary critics, Dante has been widely studied by scientists both past and present.  \nYou will be escorted on your journey through Dante\u2019s comedy by characters like Beatrice, Pier delle Vigne and Ulysses, but also by some of the most famous scientists, like Albert Einstein, to see how Dante Alighieri\u2019s description of the cosmos in 1300 was later verified by modern science.  \nIn this way, the Comedy succeeds in conveying how precious Dante's thoughts are and shows 21st century readers that science and poetry do not have to be separated but constitute the unity of universal knowledge.", "start": "2017-10-23T04:00:00", "short_description": "Comprendere l\u2019avvicendarsi del discorso poetico e scientifico nella Commedia Dantesca, per avvicinare l\u2019uomo \u00aba quell\u2019amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle\u00bb.", "pacing_type": "instructor_paced", "key": "course-v1:FedericaX+Fed05+3T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "FedericaX", "level_type": "Introductory", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["Italian"], "program_types": []},

Here, citizens play an important role amidst governments, companies, NGOs and researchers in creating social, technological and political innovations for achieving sustainability.\nCitizens can be co-creators of sustainable cities when they engage in city politics or in the design of the urban environment and its technologies and infrastructure. In addition, citizens influence and are influenced by the technologies and systems that they use every day. Sustainability is thus a result of the interplay between technology, policy and people\u2019s daily lives. Understanding this interplay is essential for creating sustainable cities. In this MOOC, we zoom in on Amsterdam, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Nairobi, Kampala and Suzhou as living labs for exploring the dynamics of co-creation for sustainable cities worldwide. We will address topics such as participative democracy and legitimacy, ICTs and big data, infrastructure and technology, and SMART technologies in daily life.\nThis global scope will be used to illustrate why specific forms of co-creation are preferred in specific urban contexts. Moreover, we will investigate and compare these cities on three themes that have a vast effect on city life: \n\nWater and waste\nEnergy, air, food and mobility\nGreen spaces and food\n\nThis MOOC will teach you about the dynamics of co-creation and the key principles of citizens interacting with service providing companies, technology and infrastructure developers, policy makers and researchers. You will gain an understanding of major types of co-creation and their interdependency with their socio-technical and political contexts. You will become equipped to indicate how you can use co-creation to develop innovative technologies, policy arrangements or social practices for a sustainable city in your own community. You will demonstrate this by developing an action plan, research proposal or project idea.\nBasic knowledge of sustainability in urban settings, urban environmental technology and urban management is assumed.\nThis course forms a part of two educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) - AMS Vital and Circular city research themes.

Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style.

From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years.

We will discuss how to use Bioconductor to simplify parallel computing for efficient, fault-tolerant, and reproducible high-performance analyses. This will be illustrated with common multicore architectures and Amazon\u2019s EC2 infrastructure. \nEnhanced interactivity: New approaches to programming with R and Bioconductor allow researchers to use the web browser as a highly dynamic interface for data interrogation and visualization. We will discuss how to create interactive reports that enable us to move beyond static tables and one-off graphics so that our analysis outputs can be transformed and explored in real time.\nEnhanced reproducibility: New methods of virtualization of software environments, exemplified by the Docker ecosystem, are useful for achieving reproducible distributed analyses. The Docker Hub includes a considerable number of container images useful for important Bioconductor-based workflows, and we will illustrate how to use and extend these for sharable and reproducible analysis.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.\nThe main component of Microsoft R Server (MRS) is the RevoScaleR package, which is an R library that offers a set of functionalities for processing large datasets without having to load them all at once in the memory. RevoScaleR offers a rich set of distributed statistical and machine learning algorithms, which get added to over time. Finally, RevoScaleR also offers a mechanism by which we can take code that we developed on our laptop and deploy it on a remote server such as SQL Server or Spark (where the infrastructure is very different under the hood), with minimal effort.\nIn this course, we will show you how to use MRS to run an analysis on a large dataset and provide some examples of how to deploy it on a Spark cluster or a SQL Server database. Upon completion, you will know how to use R for big-data problems.\nSince RevoScaleR is an R package, we assume that the course participants are familiar with R. A solid understanding of R data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, environments) is required. For example, students should be able to confidently tell the difference between a list and a data frame, or what each object is generally a good representation for and how to subset it. Students should be familiar with basic programming concepts such as control flows, loops, functions and scope. Students should have a good understanding of how to write and debug R functions. Finally, students are expected to have a good understanding of data manipulation and data processing in R (e.g. functions such as merge, transform, subset, cbind, rbind, lapply, apply).

An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required.\nEmbedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner.\nIn this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software.

Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges.\nIf you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you!\nThere are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship.\nThis MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme.\nBecause we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community.\nYou will discover possible solutions for your city\u2019s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems.\nWe invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in!\nThis course forms a part of the educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions and is developed by Wageningen UR and TU Delft, two of the founding universities of AMS Institute.", "start": "2017-03-14T04:00:00", "short_description": "Learn why cities are key in resolving global urbanization and sustainability challenges and how you can engineer tomorrow\u2019s cities today.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:DelftWageningenX+AMS.URB.1x+1T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "DelftWageningenX", "level_type": "Introductory", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": []},

It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections. \nFirst, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. \nSecond, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions \u2013 from both within and outside of the supply chain. Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. \nFinally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.\nMITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management\nThe MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management is specifically designed and administered by MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL) to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting and growing field.

Responsive cities change the way the technology of a smart city is used. The first Smart Cities were technology driven and they produced large amounts of data from fixed or centrally controlled sensors.

Rather than using data that are centrally collected and stored, you will see platforms on which the citizens place the data and the information they decide to share.

A model is a simplified representation of a real situation and modeling is the process of developing, analyzing and interpreting a model in order to help make better decisions. Models can be invaluable tools in managing and understanding the complexity and risk inherent in many business problems. As a result, models have become an increasingly important part of business at all levels from daily operations to strategic decision making.\nThis course will help learners become intelligent users and consumers of these models. To this end, we will cover the basic elements of modeling \u2013 how to formulate a model and how to use and interpret the information a model produces. The course emphasizes \u201clearning by doing\u201d so that students will be expected to formulate, solve, and interpret a number of different optimization and simulation models using Excel spreadsheets. An important theme in the course is to understand the appropriate use of models in business and the potential pitfalls from using models incorrectly or inappropriately.\nThe course has two distinct parts:\n\nThe first half of the course we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification. In this framework, we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs. We will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization. Our approach will be more practically motivated, meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms, but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theory.\nIn the second half, we shift to unsupervised learning techniques. In these problems the end goal less clear-cut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input. We will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning: data clustering, matrix factorization, and sequential models for order-dependent data.

The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales & Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.\nThe main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:\n\nSupply Chain Network Design\nSupply Chain Finance\nSupplier Management\nProduction and Demand Planning\nProcess and Organizational Design\n\nThis course is indispensable if you\u2019re considering a supply chain management career and, specifically, the positions of Supply Chain Analyst, Operations Manager, or Logistics Coordinator.\nMITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management\nThe MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management is specifically designed and administered by MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL) to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting and growing field.

In the R Basics course, we learn the basic building blocks of R. As done in all our courses, we use motivating case studies, we ask specific questions, and learn by answering these through data analysis. Our assessments use code checking technology that will permit you to get hands-on practice during the courses.\nThroughout the series, we will be using the R software environment. You will learn R, statistical concepts, and data analysis techniques simultaneously. In this course, we will introduce the necessary basic R syntax to get you going. However, rather than cover every R skill you need, we introduce just enough so you can continue learning in the next courses, which will provide more in depth coverage. We believe that you can better retain R knowledge when you learn it to solve a specific problem. The motivating question in this course relates to crime in the United States and we provide a relevant dataset. You will learn some basic R skills to permit us to answer specific questions about differences across the different states.\nHarvardX has partnered with DataCamp for all assignments.

There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. \nYour score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.\nProgramming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\nYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\nNothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.\nWhat computer system do I need for the course?\nThe course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.\nWill I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?\nThis is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.\nCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\nYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.\nI have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?\nIn most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.\nI have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?\nThe course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.\n", "start": "2017-09-19T04:00:00", "short_description": "Learn to create images of 3D scenes in both real-time and with realistic ray tracing in this introductory computer graphics course.", "pacing_type": "self_paced", "key": "course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+CSE167x+3T2017", "published": true, "enrollment_end": null, "org": "UCSanDiegoX", "level_type": "Intermediate", "availability": "Current", "transcript_languages": ["English"], "program_types": ["Professional Certificate"]},

What\u2019s more, the media often offers support for whichever opinions appear most popular at any given time. This leaves those of us who like to base our decisions on firm, provable facts feeling dizzy.  \n\u201cThe Science of Parenting\u201d addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by looking directly at the science. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents \u2013 or future parents \u2013 make sensible, informed decisions.  \nOne goal of this course will be to provide a survey of important scientific findings spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents: \n\ndiet;\nsleep;\ndiscipline;\nlearning;\nscreen time;\nimpulse control;\nvaccination.\n\nWe\u2019ll also explore ongoing mysteries, like what causes autism, and why so many children are allergic to peanuts.  \nPerhaps more important, this course will not only dig into existing science, but will also explore the underlying nature of parenting science itself. Often, scientists measure correlations: they ask how different parenting practices are related to different behaviors in children. But the claims they make from correlational data are often much, much stronger. For example, from correlational data, scientists often claim that parents cause the behaviors of their kids. This course will show how this type of error \u2013 common in the scientific literature \u2013 can explain a significant amount of the confusion present in the media and general public. We will discuss how to avoid the same error when evaluating science, and how to use the sum of available evidence to inform decision making.  \nThe course\u2019s instructor, David Barner, is a leading authority on cognitive development. He is joined by leading experts on behavior genetics, vaccination, autism, lying, and spanking, as well as by real live parents who try to use science to inform their decisions.
